# data-maker

This is a very (almost too) simple python script to generate a csv file with 500k records of fake "Candidates". Uses the `faker` library to generate the data, plus `random` to generate a random ID. The data for each Candidate is:
- `id`: A 13 char long composed of 3 uppercase letters, followed by 10 digits
- `name`: A random name generated by `faker`
- `job`: A random job title generated by `faker`
- `company`: A random company name generated by `faker`

Really, there's not much more to say about this...
